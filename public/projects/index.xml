      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/freyalaluna/Asynchronous-Chess-App&#34;&gt;https://github.com/freyalaluna/Asynchronous-Chess-App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was my term project for my Software Design course, built by a team of myself and four other students. At the start of the semester, we were tasked with creating a full-stack application based on the requirements given by our &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo; (i.e. our professor) written in plain English, essentially tasking us with building a web application that allowed for users to play games of chess with each other asynchronously. Over the course of the first month, we were told to not do any sort of coding, instead spending that time focusing on Agile planning. Over the course of several meetings, we turned our customer&amp;rsquo;s requirements into more actionable user stories with story points assigned to each. After we had parsed all of that, we turned our attention towards creating design artifacts that would guide our future development, namely UML diagrams for our backend and UX rapid prototypes for our frontend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
