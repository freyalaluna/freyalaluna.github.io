      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-first-job-as-a-software-developer&#34;&gt;My first job as a software developer&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I graduated in the Spring of 2023, I was recommended to apply to a program called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.outreachy.org/&#34;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt; by one of my peers. The program seeks to give burgeoning developers from marginalized backgrounds a chance to get experience through the realm of Open-Source Software. After several months of working on my application and contributing to the Firefox backend, I was chosen as one of five interns to work at Mozilla under the direct guidance of two Principle developers there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
